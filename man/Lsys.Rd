\title{Rewrite an Axiom Using Production Rules to Give a String Ready for Turtle Graphics}
\usage{
Lsys(init = NULL, rules = NULL, n = 5, retAll = TRUE, verbose = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{init}{A character string giving variables (symbols) to use as the initial string
Also known as the axiom.}

\item{rules}{A data frame containing columns "inp" and "out".  These contain the input
variables and the corresponding replacement string.  See the examples in
\code{\link{drawLsys}}.}

\item{n}{An integer giving the number of cycles or iterations desired.}

\item{retAll}{Logical.  If \code{TRUE}, the result at each cycle will be returned,
otherwise only the last result is returned.}

\item{verbose}{An integer giving the level of information desired as the calculation
proceeds.  \code{verbose = 1L} gives basic information at each cycle.
Any value greater than 1 gives much more detail.  Supress messages by using a value
less than 1.}
}
\value{
If \code{retAll = FALSE}, a character vector of length 1 giving the string
at the end processing.  Otherwise, a character vector of length \code{n + 1}
containing \code{init} plus the results at the end of each iteration.
}
\description{
This is the central function for rewriting an initial string of symbols (the axiom)
into a new string using production rules.  Production rules are very simple: if
the symbol is A, turn it into something.  If it is B, turn it into something else.
Production rules typically contain instructions about moving while drawing,
moving w/o drawing, changing direction, or storing the current state for re-use later.
